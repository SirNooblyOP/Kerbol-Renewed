# Kerbol System Renewed v0.3.0 Volumetric cloud support!

### About

Kerbol System Renewed is a mod that moves around stock celestial bodies to be similar to our solar system, including changing the orbital inclination of planets and eccentricity for a more true to life and challenging experience. In this process i've had the need to implement a new gas giant beyond Jool to better accommodate the already existing celestials bodies.

This is my first mod and post on the forums, but i've been playing KSP for 7 years. I plan to add more features as i learn, listed below.

### Existing features

All stock celestial bodies keep their original size and characteristics for gameplay purposes.

* New gas giant with rings further than Jool called “Juni”.
* Most bodies have been moved to a more true to life experience without major overhauls.
* Kerbin inclined to 23.5 degrees to simulate axial tilt, all other planets and moons follows this inclination, with their respective changes in their degrees.
* All bodies have a rotation rework and follows their real life counterparts.
* Gilly now orbiting Duna. (Deimos)
* Minmus now orbiting Juni as the first moon of the system. (Enceladus)
* Ike moved as the further planet from Kerbol. (Pluto)
* Laythe now orbiting Juni as the second moon of the system. (Titan)
* Vall now oribiting Jool as the last moon of the system. (Callisto)
* Tylo now orbiting Jool as the third moon of the System. (Ganymede)
* Bop now orbiting Ike. (Charon)
* Pol now orbiting Jool as the inner most moon of the system. (Io)
* Eeloo now orbiting Jool as the second moon in the system. (Europa)

### Planned features

* Juni rework
* Adding thin ring to Jool.
* Minmus volumetric geyser jets.
* Laythe denser cloud coverage.
* Duna smaller ice caps.

### Instalation

* Extract the GameData folder found in the .zip directly into your Kerbal Space Program install directory.

### Dependencies

* Kopernicus - https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases
* Module Manager - https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-1

### Changelog

v0.3.0

* Added Scatterer support for Juni.
* Added Blackrack's Volumetrics support for Juni.
* Small rework on Juni's texture.
* Rework of Juni's ring.
