# Kerbol Renewed v0.1.0 (W.I.P.)

### About

Kerbol Renewed is a mod that moves around stock celestial bodies to be similar to our solar system, including changing the orbital inclination of planets and eccentricity for a more true to life and challenging experience. In this process i've had the need to implement a new gas giant beyond Jool to better accommodate the already existing celestials bodies.

This is my first mod and post on the forums, but i've been playing KSP for 7 years. I plan to add more features as i learn, listed below.

### Existing features

All stock celestial bodies keep their original size and characteristics for gameplay purposes.

* New gas giant with rings further than Jool called “Juni”.
* Celestials moved to better simulate our solar system.
* Gilly now orbiting Duna. (Deimos)
* Minmus now orbiting Juni as the first moon of the system. (Enceladus)
* Ike moved as the further planet from Kerbol. (Pluto)
* Laythe now orbiting Juni as the second moon of the system. (Titan)
* Vall now oribiting Jool as the last moon of the system. (Callisto)
* Tylo now orbiting Jool as the third moon of the System. (Ganymede)
* Bop now orbiting Ike. (Charon)
* Pol now orbiting Jool as the inner most moon of the system. (Io)
* Eeloo now orbiting Jool as the second moon in the system. (Europa)
* Kerbin inclined to 23.5 degrees to simulate axial tilt, all other planets and moons follows this inclinations, so in map view everything will appear tilted.

### Planned features

* Kerbol retexture, corona and sunflare.
* Eve retexture, making it more Venus alike, whiteish/yellow atmosphere, orangeish/brown * surface and water.
* Duna retexture making it less red and smaller ice caps.
* Dres retexture similar to KSP2 and adding thin rings.
* Laythe denser clounds with yellowish tint.
* Minmus retexture surface and geiser style jets.
* Jool retexture to appear more like Jupiter, light colors most likely and thin ring.
* Adding support for EVE volumetrics to Juni.

### Instalation

* Extract the GameData folder found in the .zip directly into your Kerbal Space Program install directory.
